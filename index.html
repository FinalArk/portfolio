                        I study web development at Wake Tech Community College and am set to graduate with an associate degree on <b>May 4, 2024.</b> I have a passion to learn everything about HTML/CSS, Javascript, and other front-end technologies while loving every step of the way.<br><br>
                        With a drive for creativity, I create and design eye-catching websites while still putting <b>functionality</b> above all else. I hope to bring this creativity with me into the workforce and <b>expand my experience and knowledge of web development.</b> <br><br>
                        When I'm not behind a computer screen, I'm enjoying my favorite show, starting my next JRPG adventure, or finding time to write short stories.

                </div>
    
                <p class="project-description">In this project, I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and CSS Grid to make a redesign of the beloved Topsail Beach located in North Carolina. I aimed to make a simple but effective multi-page design as well as create a custom logo using VistaPrint.com. This project challenged me to think about and rework an existing design while still trying to remain faithful to the original. If I were to approach this project again, I think I'd play around with a different color palette. I tried using the original to stay consistent, but the colors don't always work well together and can cause some accessibility issues.</p>

                </div>
    
                <p class="project-description-2">The Tyrell County Redesign Project was very similar to the Topsail Beach Project. I was tasked with redesigning another website, this time a county's very old website. For this project, I took a similar approach to HTML, CSS, and CSS Grid to do most of the work. I went bigger on the redesign though and cut the navigational window nearly to 3/4 of what it originally was. This project challenged me with redesigning the navigation into something different. I had to decide what was important and what the site could do without. If I visited this site again, I'd go back and change the navigation yet again. I wasn't happy with the final product and knew I could do better.</p>

                </div>
    
                <p class="project-description-3">The Resume Builder was the first big project I tackled that primarily used Javascript. Using the HTML parse feature and clicking a button to activate the feature on click. The builder would create a complete resume based on the information that the user put into each of the fields. This was a challenging project, as the parsing feature wasn't the easiest to work with. I would like to revisit this project in the future, as I feel like the design is very bland and not appealing at all. I know I could do much more with the knowledge I have now about both design and HTML/CSS.</p>
